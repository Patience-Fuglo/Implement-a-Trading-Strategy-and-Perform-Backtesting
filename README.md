# Implement-a-Trading-Strategy-and-Perform-Backtesting

## Project Overview

As a quantitative researcher, the objective of this project is to explore and develop strategies that the firm can use to make profitable financial transactions. These transactions will encompass both short-term and long-term investments. The project will leverage data from OpenBB, an investment research platform that provides free access to data on cryptocurrencies, forex, futures, stocks, and more.

## Introduction

In the fast-paced world of finance, data-driven investment strategies are crucial for making informed and profitable decisions. This project aims to investigate and develop robust investment strategies using historical and real-time financial data. By leveraging the extensive datasets provided by OpenBB, we can analyze market trends, identify investment opportunities, and optimize our portfolio management.

## Objectives

- Explore and analyze financial data from multiple asset classes including crypto, forex, futures, and stocks.
- Develop both short-term and long-term investment strategies.
- Validate and backtest the developed strategies using historical data.
- Optimize the strategies for maximum profitability and risk management.

## Installation

To get started with this project in C++, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/.....
    cd implement-trading-strategy-backtesting

2. **Install dependencies:**
    Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed. You might also need additional libraries such as Boost, cURL, and any other dependencies required for your specific strategy implementations.

3. **Compile the project:**
g++ -o investment_thesis src/main.cpp src/dual_class_arbitrage.cpp 

## Data Sources
This project uses data from Alpha Vantage. Alpha Vantage provides access to various financial data.

## Methodology
The methodology for developing the investment strategies involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Fetch historical and real-time data from OpenBB for different asset classes.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Prepare the data for analysis by handling missing values, normalizing, and transforming features.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the data to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations.
4. **Strategy Development**: Develop investment strategies based on insights from the EDA. This may include technical indicators, machine learning models, and algorithmic trading techniques.
5. **Backtesting**: Validate the strategies using historical data to evaluate their performance.
6. **Optimization**: Fine-tune the strategies to maximize returns and manage risks.
7. **Deployment**: Implement the optimized strategies for live trading (optional).

### Trading Strategies

Some example strategies you can implement and backtest include:

1. **Dual Class Arbitrage**: Exploit the price discrepancy between stocks that have dual listings (e.g., GOOG vs. GOOGL).
2. **Bollinger Band Strategy**: Use Bollinger Bands, which are calculated using the 20-day simple moving average (SMA) and two standard deviations of the stock price.
3. **Reinforcement Learning Algorithm**: Develop a reinforcement learning model to trade a specific financial product.
4. **Sector-Based Pairs Trading Algorithm**: Capitalize on the deviations in the prices of two assets within the same sector by buying the falling asset and/or shorting the rising asset.

2. **Compile the project:**
 g++ -o investment_thesis src/main.cpp src/dual_class_arbitrage.cpp 

3. **Run the executable:**
./investment_thesis

4. **Analyze the results**:
The results will be saved in the `results` directory. You can analyze the performance metrics and visualizations to evaluate the strategies.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the implementation of various trading strategies using C++ and backtesting them with historical data from Alpha Vantage. Each strategy leverages different methodologies to identify and capitalize on market opportunities. The results highlight the strategies' performances, providing insights into their profitability and effectiveness.


Happy Investing!
